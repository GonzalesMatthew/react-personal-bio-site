          Hi, my name is Matthew and I am a creative individual that loves
          creative people and activities. Some of my favorite hobbies include
          composing, hiking, travel, and meeting new people. I have an undergrad
          degree from UCSDs math department and have been doing analytics for
          some time. When the most enjoyable part is dashboard development and
          building the data pipelines thats when you know you should become a
          full-time dev. Outside of development I enjoy MMA, F1 racing, cooking
          new recipes, and studying financial markets.
