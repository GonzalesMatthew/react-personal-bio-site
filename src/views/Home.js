          Hello, my name is Matthew Gonzales. After years in analytics I decided to become a developer to pursue creative ventures 24/7! I love coding and I find my fellow developers to be amazing people to work with that also love contributing meaningful code to society. My best skill as a developer is seeing the big picture and making an effective plan to get the job done quickly, accurately, and effectively.

          Some of my favorite hobbies all involve creativity, and include composing music, hiking, and traveling. I also enjoy watching mixed martial arts and F1 racing, cooking, studying financial markets, gardening, and decorating my home.
