          Hello, my name is Matthew and I consider myself to be a creative indidual.I pursued development to constantly work creatively and to spend more time with people who enjoy doing the same. I graduated from the University of California, San Diego, and have been in analytics for a number of years before switching to development. Some of my favorite hobbies include composing music, hiking, traveling, and making new friends. I also enjoy watching mixed martial arts and F1 racing, cooking, studying financial markets, and decorating my home.
